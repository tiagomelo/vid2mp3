A simple command-line utility to extract audio from video files and convert it to MP3 format.

`vid2mp3` is designed to be small, dependency-light, and easy to integrate into scripts, Makefiles, and automation workflows.

---

## features

* Convert video files to MP3
* Supports common video formats (via [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/))
* Simple CLI interface
* Suitable for batch processing
* No [Go](https://go.dev) runtime dependencies at execution time

---

## requirements

* [**ffmpeg**](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) must be installed and available on `$PATH`

Verify installation:

```bash
ffmpeg -version
```

---

## installation

### using `go install`

```bash
go install github.com/tiagomelo/vid2mp3/cmd/vid2mp3@latest
```

The binary will be installed into:

```bash
$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Make sure it is on your `PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$(go env GOPATH)/bin:$PATH"
```

---

## usage

### basic usage

```bash
vid2mp3 input.mp4
```

This generates:

```text
input.mp3
```

in the same directory.

---

### specify output file

```bash
vid2mp3 -o output.mp3 input.mp4
```

---

### batch conversion

```bash
for f in *.mp4; do
  vid2mp3 "$f"
done
```

---

## examples

Convert a video downloaded from the web:

```bash
vid2mp3 lecture.mp4
```

Convert and rename output:

```bash
vid2mp3 -o podcast.mp3 recording.mkv
```

Use inside a Makefile:

```make
extract-audio:
	vid2mp3 assets/video.mp4
```

---

## how it works

Internally, `vid2mp3` invokes [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) with the appropriate arguments to:

* strip video streams
* extract audio
* encode it as MP3

This keeps the implementation simple and reliable by relying on a proven media tool.

---

## error handling

* Fails fast if [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) is not available
* Propagates [`ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) errors directly to `stderr`
* Returns non-zero exit codes on failure (script-friendly)

---

## development

### run locally

```bash
go run ./cmd/vid2mp3/vid2mp3.go input.mp4
```

---

### unit tests

```bash
make test
```

### unit tests coverage report

```bash
make coverage
